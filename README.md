# React Test Task

As a bonus I implemented:

- any additional visual effects to highlight positive or negative changes in the prices
- the possibility to switch on/off tickers by user.
  You can hide the specific ticker in the component Ticker which contain interested one
- the possibility to specify interval time by user
  In Input component
- the possibility to add/remove ticker from watching group
  In component Ticker you can delete specific one and add a new ticker in AddTicker component

I used the next technologies:

- React (preferable with hooks)
- Redux (with Redux-Thunk or any other Redux middleware you are familiar) or any other state-manager library you want
- Socket.io - to connect to the service
- any UI library you want, or you can use just pure CSS
- Testing Library
